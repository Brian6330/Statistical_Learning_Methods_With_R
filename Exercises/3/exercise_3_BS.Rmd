## Preliminaries
Loading the mean dataset:

```{r}
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))

mean20_df = read.csv("Mean20.txt", header = TRUE, comment.char = "#")
```

Handle the outliers:

-   Remove NAs

-   Remove illogical values (<= 0)


```{r}
temp_mean20_df <- mean20_df
temp_mean20_df[temp_mean20_df <= 0] <- NA
cleaned_mean20_df <- na.omit(temp_mean20_df)
summary(cleaned_mean20_df)
```
```{r}
sd(cleaned_mean20_df$time)
```
\newpage

## 2. Suppose that mean dealy between two calls is 7.05 minutes. Can you test this hypothesis using the availablae data? What is your conclusion? Do you see a difference when considering the original values and the preprocessed values?
